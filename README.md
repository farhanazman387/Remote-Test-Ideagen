My first react app

1. this project use npm for package manager.
2. the goal of this project is to built a Sales Order Record web application using react.js with only class component
3. as this is my first time creating react app without using CRA(create react app), i will create a step by step tutorial
4. in this project, im using macbook pro, and vs code as tool.
5. we will start by creating a folder, named the folder. then right click at the folder, choose 'New terminal at folder'
6. from your terminal write a command 
    ```````````````
        code .
    ```````````````
7. it will start vs code, and you can see an empty folder. open a terminal in vs code, write a command
    ````````````````
        npm init -y
    ````````````````
8. you will have to install npm for package manager.
9. on the same terminal, you need to install react, write the following command
    ```````````````````````````````````
        npm install react react-dom
    ```````````````````````````````````
10. next, you will need babel for js and jsx (google)
11. and webpack to build the project (google)
12. now you have complete the basic need for a react app.
